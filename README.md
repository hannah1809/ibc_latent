# ibc_latent

### Note, this repo has been transferred to the Lab github page of the Cognitive Neuroscience & Neurotechnology Lab led by Dr. Romy Lorenz ([Cognitive-Neuroscience-Neurotechnology/ibc_latent](https://github.com/Cognitive-Neuroscience-Neurotechnology/ibc_latent)).

Analysis code using the publicly available IBC (Individual Brain Charting) dataset.

**Goal**: Build latent representations of multiple cognitive tasks to better understand the Frontoparietal Network.

Raw data can be found on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002685/versions/1.3.1). Preprocessed version of the data on [Ebrains](https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/44214176-0e8c-48de-8cff-4b6f9593415d). Overview about acquisition, tasks, preprocessing can be found in the [Official IBC Documentation](https://individual-brain-charting.github.io/docs/tasks.html#attention).
